## Hi Community ##

I am Archy Van, a iOS developer and currently learning SwiftUI.

This project was totally inspired by [Sam Lu](https://twitter.com/samvlu)'s [100 Days of Swift](http://samvlu.com/index.html) project, after read his [Medium post](https://medium.com/@samvlu/100-days-of-swift-736d45a19b63#.ayz5vx6mc) I made a decision to put some day to write SwiftUI, this's the final code of n tiny SwiftUI projects.
